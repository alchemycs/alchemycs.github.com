Quick and simple, I <mark>make stuff for the web</mark> as both a 
[career][Career Programmer] and as a [hobby]. I must admit it has been more about
career over the last few years so it's time to get some more hobby - something 
I hope my [GitHub] account will help with. 	

I've almost 20 years' experience in online software development and managed deployments 
of web-based software across a range of corporate environments in a number of countries.

##What?
I have a background in
Electrical Engineering (Communications) and currently work as the CTO for a 
company that provides *legally inspired organisational content integration* 
where I develop and manage <mark>over 60 intranet sites</mark> for various
*ASX listed* and *financial services* companies.


##Where?
I'm based in [Australia], with strong links to [Thailand][] (both family and 
family business). But seriously - on the Internet who cares?

##How?
Like any web developer worth their salt, I have quite an extensive range of knowledge
in all things Internet related, but the technologies I tend to gravitate toward when developing
include (but are most *definitely not limited to*):

- The Agavi enterprise grade PHP application framework
- PostgreSQL (preferred), YQL, MySQL
- PHP, JavaScript (I like using YUI)
- HTML5/CSS3
- Apache web server
- Asterisk (open PBX server)
- Git, Phing, SVN
- I also have proficiencies and familiarity with a whole swag of acronyms - if you want to know, just ask!
