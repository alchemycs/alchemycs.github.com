What Are You Doing Here?
------------------------
From my [about page] you will see I work for a very *corporate* style company 
that likes to protect the software we produce. 

That's fine, patents and copyright are still a big part of the corporate 
landscape, but it doesn't quite satisfy the need for community involvement and
sharing with peers. 

I'm also very interested in getting more involved with developer evangelism.


What Will You Blog About?
-------------------------
Here I'll be putting down ideas I have for projects in an attempt to get some of 
them going, or just some ideas and tinkering.

I expect my coding here will be a little slow since my "day job" at the moment
does take up a lot of my energy, and I do love spending time with my family.
