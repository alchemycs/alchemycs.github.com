What Are You Doing Here?
------------------------
From my [about page] you will see I work for a very *corporate* style company that likes to protect
the software it (or more correctly, I) produces. I'm also stuck on some 
<mark>gnarly-last-century-oh-god-what-am-I-doing-here</mark> kind of code that drives me absolutely mad!

So I'm hoping do to a bit more <mark>open source</mark> kind of stuff that is <mark>relevant to this era</mark> and <mark>fun to work on</mark>
rather than something I just do for a <mark>pay cheque</mark>.

What Will You Blog About?
-------------------------
My semi-professional blog is located at <http://careerprogrammer.tumblr.com>, but here I'll be putting down ideas 
I have for projects in an attempt to get some of them going. I expect my coding here will be a little slow
since my "day job" burns me out quite a bit and I love spending time with my family.

I'll probably also vent a bit - I'm the sole programmer at my job but get referred to as "the development team" on tweets,
blogs and newsletters, but as "our IT geek/guru" when introduced individually. Hmmmmm....
