title: Five Box Risk Matrix
---

Governance, Risk and Compliance systems always seem to have very poor looking
interfaces (a la internet explorer 6) for people to rate risks. I put together
this quick proof of concept that takes advantage of HTML 5 slider controls that
allows you to have something a little more palatable.

Use the sliders to set the <mark>consequence</mark> and <mark>likelihood</mark>
ratings which will result in the <mark>risk rating</mark> being updated in real
time.

Alternatively you can click on one of the cells directly in the table to set
the rating.

Try it out on my [Playground Pages](http://alchemycs.github.com/Playground/FiveBoxRiskMatrix/index.html)
page, or take a peek at the source code on my [GitHub Playground Repository](https://github.com/alchemycs/Playground).
