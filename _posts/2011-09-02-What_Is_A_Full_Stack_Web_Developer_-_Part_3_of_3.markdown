title: What Is A Full Stack Web Developer - Part 3 of 3
---


Essentially what's different from a full stack web developer and another web 
developer is a deeper understanding on the underlying web technologies, the 
ability to run a complete network & hosting structure, and a broader understanding
of parallel technologies.

##Part 3 - The Web Application

This is where things get interesting. At least, this is where end
users start to see stuff!

Here is where the developer defines your web application and creates
the models that represent your data, the business logic to make the
data work in usefull ways and the framework that coordinates the model
the logic and the user experience.

Not only does a web developer need to know how to do all of these
things, they must also know the best way to optimise things like
images, video, style sheets and much, much more!
