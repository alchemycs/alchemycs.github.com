title: What Is A Full Stack Web Developer - Part 2 of 3
---


Essentially what's different from a full stack web developer and another web 
developer is a deeper understanding on the underlying web technologies, the 
ability to run a complete network & hosting structure, and a broader understanding
of parallel technologies.

##Part 2 - The Application Stack

The Application Stack provides the server side web developer the language and 
interfaces to the system to build applications. It provides storage such as 
databases and file systems and the ability to call other API's

There are various languages and databases that a developer can use, and this choice
can depend on the underlying operating system, the needs of the application and
the confidence of the programmer.

Popular choices for the server side development include PHP, Python and JSP, however
it is interesting to see Node, which is based on JavaScript, being developed. Because
Node uses JavaScript, it means that the language on the back end is the same as
the language on the front end in the browser!

One of the most popular database choices for simple applications is MySQL, however
for applications more than simple Content Management Systems a more robust database
needs to be used such as PostrgreSQL or Oracle.
