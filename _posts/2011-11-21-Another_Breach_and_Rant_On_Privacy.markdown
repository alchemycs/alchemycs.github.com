title: Another Breach/Rant On Privacy
---

Ok, so this post isn't about something I have done or used, or about some cool 
piece of technology I have come across. Rather, this post is <mark>yet another rant on privacy erosion</mark>
that has come about because of a breach in my own personal information from people that
should know better.

The build up to this rant started on Saturday, so <em>I did</em> have time to calm down 
from wanting to tell everyone they are idiots and anathematize myself to 
selling hand woven baskets at the local markets.

However my calm was immediately damaged on a morning walk when I 
spotted this <a href="/images/camera.jpg">portable surveillance device</a> 
complete with GPS and facial recognition, sitting calmly near some pedestrian 
traffic lights on George Street (Sydney).


##So what happened on Saturday?

In my post <a href="http://careerprogrammer.tumblr.com/post/2973484717/mail-insecurity">Mail Insecurity</a> originally posted on 4th April 2010 
and re-posted on 28th January 2011 I said,

<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 20px">
The scariest part for me is not about ME sending personal data, but other people 
sending personal data about me! I can easily envisage HR personnel communicating 
with the companies superannuation provider about my account and sending personal 
information such as my tax file number, date of birth and address. Wow, that's 
enough to identify me over the phone with any utility provider or even my bank! 
Scary...
</blockquote>

And this has most certainly come to pass:

I was looking at my calendar and saw that it showed birthdays and other pesonal dates of
people I know, including <strong>my upcoming holiday plans</strong>. This grabbed my
attention since I never put it into my calendar. Upon investigation I found that
someone had been using their public event calendar to also to keep track of their personal
dates of interest!

People who know me know my strong (sometimes extreme) viewpoint on privacy and security and they should
know better. What makes this more dumb founding is I gave a talk only a month ago
on [Why Information Security is Important](http://alchemycs.github.com/2011/10/04/Why_Is_Information_Security_Important.html).

So one of two things has happened here:

1. My talk wasn't good enough and I didn't drive the point home enough.
2. People simply lack the brain capacity to understand
privacy, or at least check if something is public or not.

##Resolution? Yeah, right!
The question remains as what to do. Sure, I can go through the usual bullshit and 
try to educate people or even give them a good verbal lashing. Again. But perhaps 
it would be more illustrative to start posting other peoples private data and see
 what happens. I get so tired of this. As <em>Jean-Paul Satre</em> said in his book
<em>No Exit</em>:

<blockquote style="margin:20px; padding-top:3em; padding-bottom: 2em;">
<p>
Hell is other people
</p>
</blockquote>

As my son recently discovered when someone offered him some jelly beans without telling
him they were deliberately flavoured distgustingly: other people can never
be trusted. Ever. The <em>X Files</em> most certainly had it correct:

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 40px 0px;">
<mark style="font-size: 40px">Trust No One</mark>
</div>

Sometimes I really do want to go off the grid and make a living selling baked goods
or hand woven baskets at the local market.
