title: Another Breach/Rant On Privacy
---


Ok, so this post isn't about something I have done or used, or about some cool 
piece of technology I have come across. Rather, this post is <mark>yet another rant on privacy erosion</mark>
that has come about because of a breach in my own personal information from people that
should know better.

The build up to this rant started on Saturday, so <em>I did</em> have time to calm down 
from <em>wanting to tell everyone at work they are idiots and resigning</em> to 
a more job secure level of <em>bubbling, simmering contempt toward my colleagues</em>.

However this "calm" was immediately destroyed on my way to work this morning when I 
spotted this <a href="/images/camera.jpg">portable surveillance device</a> 
complete with GPS and facial recognition, sitting calmly near some pedestrian 
traffic lights on George Street (Sydney).


##So what happened on Saturday?

In my post <a href="http://careerprogrammer.tumblr.com/post/2973484717/mail-insecurity">Mail Insecurity</a> originally posted on 4th April 2010 
and re-posted on 28th January 2011 I said,

<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 20px">
The scariest part for me is not about ME sending personal data, but other people 
sending personal data about me! I can easily envisage HR personnel communicating 
with the companies superannuation provider about my account and sending personal 
information such as my tax file number, date of birth and address. Wow, that's 
enough to identify me over the phone with any utility provider or even my bank! 
Scary...
</blockquote>

And this has most certainly come to pass:

I was looking at my calendar and saw that it showed some of my colleagues birthdays 
and upcoming leave, it also had <strong>my upcoming leave</strong>. This grabbed my
attention since I never put it into my calendar. Upon investigation I found that the
company public event calendar is the same one being used on our internal intranet,
and has had this personal information posted on it for the world to see.

This is the <strong>second time my personal information has been breached in the last
year and half</strong>. What makes this more dumb founding is I gave a talk only a month ago
on [Why Information Security is Important](http://alchemycs.github.com/2011/10/04/Why_Is_Information_Security_Important.html).

So one of two things has happened here:

1. My talk wasn't good enough and I didn't drive the point home enough.
2. The other staff in the office simply lack the brain capacity to understand
privacy, or at least check if something is public or not.

##Resolution? Yeah, right!
The question remains as what to do. Sure, I can go through the usual corporate
bullshit and lodge a complaint. Again. But perhaps it would be more illustrative
to start posting other peoples private data and see what happens. I could lock down
the network and make everyone submit a request for the sites they need to visit 
with a reason as to why they need access to the site to complete their work.
However this would simply mean more work for me and staff would find other ways to
screw up that may be harder to monitor and control.

However none of these fix the underlying principal that is other people can never
be trusted with your information. Ever. The <em>X Files</em> most certainly had it correct:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 40px;">
<mark style="font-size: 40px">Trust No One</mark>
</div>

Sometimes I really do want to go off the grid and make a living selling baked goods
at the local market.
