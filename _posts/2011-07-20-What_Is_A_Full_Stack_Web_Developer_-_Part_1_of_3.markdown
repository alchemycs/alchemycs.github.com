title: What Is A Full Stack Web Developer - Part 1 of 3
---


When people ask me what I am I tell them I'm a "Full Stack Web Developer" which
often has the response, "Oh..computers?"

Fair enough...

So to help friends, family and colleagues to understand what I do I put together
this little presentation and screen cast.

Essentially what's different from a full stack web developer and another web 
developer is a deeper understanding on the underlying web technologies, the 
ability to run a complete network & hosting structure, and a broader understanding
of parallel technologies.

##Part 1 - The Hosting System
Every web application and web site has to be come from somewhere, this is the
hosting system. A web site could be somewhere local such as the free web hosting
your ISP provides, or it could be on a dedicated server you rent somewhere.

The full stack web developer will configure and provide the whole underlying 
structure for your web application. This will involve sourcing an appropriate
server and provision hosting in a data center. It could also be a cloud service
such as Amazon Web Services or Google App Engine.

Next comes the installation of the [Operating System][] (OS). This is what makes
the computer work in the first place. It coordinates between all the [hardware]
input/output devices and the [programs][] that run on the computer

Finally there are the supporting services. This is not just software installed 
on the server such as the actual web server program, but also registering and
configuring a domain name and it's associated [Domain Name System][] (DNS), 
configuring and securing [email services][] (MTA), [firewalls][], [security patches][] and 
a whole bunch of other things just to make the server able to work as expected.
