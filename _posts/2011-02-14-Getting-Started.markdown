##[EarthExplorer.info]
I'm in the process of cleaning up the code for [EarthExplorer.info] so I can
put it on [GitHub]. Mainly adding a little documentation and cleaning out 
private data.

##RoadWork (Needs a better name)
Also in the process of putting together a management tool for 
[AWS Route 53][Route53]. Like all my projects (that I have control over anyway) 
it's based on the [Agavi Professional PHP Application Framework][agavi].

##Valentines Day
Since this first post is on Valentines Day, why not take a peek with a loved one
at my wife's blog, [Ashley's Garden]. It's been a little while since the last
update, but she assures me she is ready to post her latest joy, 
a blue water lilly!
